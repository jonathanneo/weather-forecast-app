# Purpose and motivation

This repo is an extension of the [weather-etl-aws](https://github.com/jonathanneo/weather-etl-aws) example repo. The weather-etl example provides students of data engineering an example of an end-to-end ETL project that runs on AWS. 

This project, weather-forecast-app, creates a machine learning model to predict weather with 88% accuracy, and allows users to enter inputs and receive a weather forecasted in return. 

The app is hosted on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk (ELB).

# Running locally 

Follow the steps below to run the code locally: 

- [1. Declare environment variables](#declare-environment-variables)
- [2. Run the application locally ](#run-the-application-locally)


### Declare environment variables 

If you look into the `app/app.py` file, you will see that there are several lines for: 

```python 
DB_USER = os.environ.get("DB_USER")
```

These lines are used to store variables that are either (1) secrets, or (2) change between environments (e.g. dev, test, production). 

We will first need to declare the values for these variables. This can easily be done by running the following in the terminal: 

<b>macOS:</b> 
```
export DB_USER="secret_goes_here"
export DB_PASSWORD="secret_goes_here"
export DB_SERVER_NAME="secret_goes_here"
export DB_DATABASE_NAME="secret_goes_here"
```

<b>windows:</b> 

```
set DB_USER=secret_goes_here
set DB_PASSWORD=secret_goes_here
set DB_SERVER_NAME=secret_goes_here
set DB_DATABASE_NAME=secret_goes_here
```

To save time running each variable in the terminal, you may wish to create script files to store the declaration of each variable. 

- macOS: store the declaration of the variables in a `config.local.sh` file 
    - run using `. ./config.local.sh` 
- windows: store the declaration of the variables in a `config.local.bat` file 
    - run using `config.local.bat` 

### Run the application locally 

To run the application locally, simply run 

```
cd app
python app.py
```

You should see the following which indicates that your app is running locally: 
```
* Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Debug mode: on
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
* Restarting with stat
* Debugger is active!
```

# AWS deployment  

Follow these steps to deploy the solution to AWS. 


### Deploy ETL to AWS Elastic Beanstalk 

#### Build app

Before we can deploy the app, we need to first build the app. 

Building the app refers to packaging and compiling the app so that it is in a state that can be readily deployed onto the target platform (e.g. AWS, Heroku, Azure, GCP, etc). We can skip the compilation since Python is not a compiled language, however we still need to package the app. 

To package the app, we will run the following lines of code: 

<b>macOS</b>:
```
zip -r web-app.zip templates static
zip -g web-app.zip app.py prediction.py requirements.txt Procfile
```

<b>windows</b>:

Note for Windows-only - You will need to install 7z (7-zip) which is a command line tool used for zipping files. 

1. Go to https://www.7-zip.org/ and download the version for your windows PC (usually 64-bit x64)
2. Run the installer .exe file 
3. Add the path `C:\Program Files\7-Zip` to your environment variables `path` 

```
7z a -tzip web-app.zip templates static
7z a -tzip web-app.zip app.py prediction.py requirements.txt Procfile
```

This will produce a `.zip` file which contains all the code and library packages required to run the app on AWS Lambda.  

For re-use, we've stored the commands in [build.sh](app/build.sh) and [build.bat](app/build.bat) respectively. 

You can just build the app by running either 

<b>macOS</b>:
```
. ./build.sh
```

<b>windows</b>:
```
build.bat
```

#### Deploy app

1. In the AWS Console, search for "Elastic Beanstalk". 
2. Choose the region closest to you on the top-right e.g. Sydney (ap-southeast-2)
3. Select "Create Application" 
4. Configure ELB. Note: Unless specified, leave the settings to default. 
    1. Provide the application name 
    2. Select Platform: "Python"
    3. Select Platform Branch: "Python 3.8 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2"
    4. In the "Application code" section, select "Upload your code"
        - Select "Local file" > "Choose file" and select the `.zip` file you have built 
    5. Select "Configure more options" 
        1. Select "Software" > "Edit"
            - Provide the environment properties based on your environment variables in [_config.template.sh](app/_config.template.sh) or [_config.template.bat](app/_config.template.bat).
            - Select "Save" 
        2. Select "Capacity" > "Edit" 
            - Under "Instance types", ensure that only "t2.micro" is selected. 
            - Select "Save" 
    6. Select "Create app"
